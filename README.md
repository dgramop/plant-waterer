# Waters plants

Firmware that moves a rack-and-pinion based robot along a welded sheet-metal and wood plant management system.

Activates a pump that we harvested from an old Kuerig, switching a power supply found in a mystery box in Dhruv's house where chargers go to die. Some CAD files are also available.

Used the [The RP2040 HAL Template](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp2040-project-template) template to boostrap this project.

Made for Patriothacks 2023
